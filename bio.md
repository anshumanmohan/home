Adrian Sampson is an associate professor in the [computer science department][cs] at [Cornell][].
He works on programming languages, computer architecture, and the abstractions that separate them.
He is especially excited about languages and compilers that make it easy for anyone to construct and exploit specialized hardware accelerators.
In a different era, he worked on [approximate computing][approx], the idea that we should design computers that compute worse answers.
