    When reading and writing papers on approximate computing, I often find myself comparing proposed systems to an imaginary ideal. Even though that ideal is clearly unrealizable, it is helpful to conceptualize it and measure the ways that real systems fall short in comparison.

A central challenge in approximate computing research is
*programmability*. It is not enough to implement relaxed execution;
developers need support to select *good* program relaxations that make a
profitable quality--efficiency trade-off.

Existing systems vary in their effectiveness at finding good relaxations
and the strengths of the guarantees they provide. Techniques can be seen
as approaching a mythical "holy grail" approximation system that finds
optimal program relaxations without intervention. This post outlines
such an ideal programming model, called **HGApprox** for *holy-grail approximation*, and
argues the fundamental reasons that it is unrealizable. Even though HGApprox is
unrealistic, it is useful as a benchmark for comparing existing work and
for setting the agenda for future work that draws closer to the ideal.

## HGApprox

HGApprox takes two inputs:

- A program, $P$, that the user wants to optimize.

- A quality metric, $Q$, which is a function from an input $x$ and $P$'s
  output, $P(x)$, to a score between 0 and 1 reflecting the output's quality.

HGApprox automatically produces a set of transformed programs, $P_i$, that are
Pareto-optimal with respect to resource usage (i.e., performance) and
total quality over all possible inputs, $\sum_x Q(x, P_i(x))$. (You
could also imagine specifying a quality loss threshold; HGApprox would then
return a single optimal transformed program $P_i$ from the Pareto
frontier.) HGApprox requires no further guidance from the programmer and is
guaranteed to produce optimal relaxations---no program may exist that has
better quality and performance.

## Compromises

Realistic approximate programming systems compromise with respect to the HGApprox
ideal in three ways that acknowledge three unfortunate realities.

### Tractability: real systems need hints.

The space of possible program relaxations $P_i$ is too large to search
for optimal relaxations. On hardware with approximate ALUs, for example,
the search space size is exponential in the number of operators in $P$.
The space may also be rife with local optima. It is infeasible for an
automated tool to find the best relaxations in this space for general
programs. Realistic systems need hints from the programmer, such as a
distinguished subset of code or data where approximation is allowed, to
help shrink the search space and guide the system to a better local
optimum.

### Quality metrics are imperfect.

Fully automatic, "black-box" tools make programmers wary---and they
should. HGApprox produces programs that are optimal with respect to the quality
metric $Q$, so any shortcomings in $Q$ are reflected in the output
programs $P_i$.

It is difficult to write a quality metric that accounts for every
possible way that things could go wrong due to approximation. An image
metric that constrains pixel value deltas works well for random errors
but can permit low-magnitude error patterns that nonetheless lead to
distracting visual artifacts---a contingency that the programmer did not
anticipate when devising $Q$.

In practice, programmers need some control over how approximation is
applied to ensure that it does not break the program in *unexpected*
ways.

### Quality is uncomputable.

Nontrivial properties of programs are undecidable (by Rice's theorem).
Quality is no exception: the problem of checking whether a candidate
program $P_i$ always meets a quality threshold (i.e.,
$\forall x \; Q(x, P_i(x)) > c$) is uncomputable.

If a realistic system cannot even evaluate a candidate relaxation's
quality, how can it hope to produce good relaxations? Realistic systems
resort to imprecise quality evaluators that fall into a few categories:

- **Offline testing.** Check the quality on representative inputs and hope that
  they generalize. This approach has the same benefits and drawbacks as
  traditional testing.

- **Static analysis**, which must be incomplete, unsound, or both. Sound,
  conservative analyses are promising but require "escape hatches" when safety
  cannot be proven.

- **Runtime checks.** On-line systems can decide *post facto* whether a
  particular computation was sufficiently accurate. Dynamic checks must be made
  cheap enough as to avoid obviating the savings offered by approximation.
  There are no bounds on the complexity of quality metrics $Q$, however, so a
  run-time check might need to use a cheaper version $$Q'$$ that sacrifices
  soundness or completeness.

## Conclusion

These three compromises are inevitable, but the community should focus
on ways that we can approach the ideal in each case. Which programmer
hints are most effective in guiding the search for approximate programs?
How can we help programmers specify better quality metrics that match
their expectations? What quality measurement strategies best capture
general run-time behavior? Each area of compromise represents an
opportunity to make approximate computing more usable for mainstream
programmers.
